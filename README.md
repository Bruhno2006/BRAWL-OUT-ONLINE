# Brawl-Out-Online
Brawl-Out, the text-based card game, is a 2-4 player battle royal where people uses weapons ranging from small, to dangerous, to extremely wacky! This is run in the Python programming language and is purely text-based, I am hoping for there to be a website version for BRAWL-OUT. (This is an online rendition of BRAWL-OUT with socket and threading).
